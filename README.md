# Bits and pieces

This repository contains bits and pieces from my various projects and coding exercises. It's not a coherent whole, just a collection of unrelated stuff.

## optimisation.ipynb and ravinteiden_saanti.py

The file ravinteiden_saanti.py contains a subset of the functions in optimisation.ipynb for testing purposes, since Jupyter notebooks do not lend themselves to testing very well.

The functions are made for playing with the Fineli food database. The current Fineli database version is 20.

You will need pandas to run the functions.

## text_functions.py

Functions that open files and do something with the contents.
